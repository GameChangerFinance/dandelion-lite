# Postgres SQL migrations

## What's this?

A system that allows you to shape and add extra functionality to the bare-bone database populated by `cardano-db-sync`

The sql files in this directory are processed and applied to PostgresDB **recursively and in order**. 

This is executed by: 
- `scripts/lib/install_postgres.sh`, which can be executed manually from `scripts/dandoman.sh` on `Setup->Initialize Postgres` 
- `scripts/lib/reset_postgres.sh`, which can be executed manually from `scripts/dandoman.sh` on `Setup->Reset Postgres` 
- or from cron automatically (TODO: test and enable this feature).
 
In all cases the script will be executed inside `postgress` container (PostgresDB service)

Running the `.sh` scripts outside `postgress` container won't work. This is why to allow these replacements to take place, you must pass the target env-vars to the `postgress` environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Rules

File paths containing
- `[SKIP]` : are blacklisted, skipped from the workflow
- `_koios-lite`      : gets applied with these `placeholder:env-var` replacements
    - `{{SCHEMA}}:$KOIOS_LITE_SCHEMA`
- `_koios-artifacts` : gets applied with these `placeholder:env-var` replacements
    - `grest/$KOIOS_ARTIFACTS_SCHEMA`
    - `GREST/$KOIOS_ARTIFACTS_SCHEMA`
- `_dandelion-postgrest` : gets applied with these `placeholder:env-var` replacements
    `{{DANDELION_POSTGREST_SCHEMA}}:$DANDELION_POSTGREST_SCHEMA`

File names starting with numbered prefixes are for prioritizing the execution of some files before others as some of the files are required by others for a smooth setup without errors.

This extensible variable system allows you to easily update these external projects to their latest versions with minimal-to-none modifications, for easy "copy-paste" updates (test your updates!).

## Notes

Is adviced to test this always from zero: by restoring/droping `PostgresDb` database, starting containers again and run `Setup -> Initialize Postgres` on `dandoman.sh` and fix errors based on the shown logs. 

Creating indexes by these sql files will take a while specially on an already indexed Cardano Mainnet database, this is normal. You can increase resources allocated for these tasks to speedup the process on `postgress` service, in `docker-compose.yaml` file, like `postgres -c maintenance_work_mem=1024MB  -c  max_parallel_maintenance_workers=4`

`Setup -> Reset Postgres` on `dandoman.sh` uninstalls all the SQL migrations on `/scripts/sql/rpc`. This is useful for example when migrating to a mayor cardano-db-sync release for keeping indexed data intact and let the indexer apply it's own migration files without other views and relationships applied on top blocking the upgrade process.
In other terms: it resets db up to cardano-db-sync level, as if only the indexer data exists on db

### Koios Artifacts

Update procedure for `scripts/sql/rpc/20_koios-artifacts-<VERSION>`:
- Download and extract latest release from [koios artifacts](https://github.com/cardano-community/koios-artifacts/tags)
- copy `koios-artifacts-<VERSION>/files/grest/rpc` as `scripts/sql/rpc/20_koios-artifacts-<VERSION>`
- This sub directory needs some file prioritization in order to work properly. Rename these directories and files this way: 
    - `/db-scripts` as  `/000_db-scripts`
    - `/db-scripts/reset_grest.sql` as `/000_db-scripts/01_reset_grest.sql`
    - `/account/account_info.sql` as `/account/01_account_info.sql`
    - `/pool/pool_delegators.sql` as `/pool/01_pool_delegators.sql`
- coment everything on `/000_db-scripts/01_reset_grest.sql` and only leave these uncomented:
    `DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS grest CASCADE;` (commented lines are called on `basics.sql`)
- check for unexpected changes that require further actions.
- update `KOIOS_VERSION` environment variable with new version number on `.env` and all `.env.example.<NETWORK>` files
