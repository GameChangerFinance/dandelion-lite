# TODO:

- Implement manifest using a JSON env var string template to simplify setup and avoid requiring cardano-sql-companion only for that. But with GCFS and Unimatrix SQL API, companion may be required anyways
- Stress-test the query function and the hash system involved
- Implement a whitelist for queries based on env vars or files.
